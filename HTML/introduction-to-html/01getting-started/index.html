    <!-- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. -->

    <!-- Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <title> tag could be written as <title>, <TITLE>, <Title>, <TiTlE>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability. -->

        <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>

    <!-- Nesting Elements 
        Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. -->

        <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

    <!-- Void Elements
        Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. -->

            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
            alt="Firefox icon" />

    <!-- Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. -->

        <p class="editor-note">My Cat is very grumpy.</p>

    <!-- An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. -->

        <p>A link to my <a  href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">favorite website</a></p>

    <!-- Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. -->

        <input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
        <input type="text">

    <!-- No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space characters, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability. -->

        <p id="noWhitespace">Dogs are silly.</p>

        <p id="whitespace">Dogs
            are
                silly.</p>

    <!-- In HTML, the characters <, >,",', and & are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself. -->

        <p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.</p>

        <p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
